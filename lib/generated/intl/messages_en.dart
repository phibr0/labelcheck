Animals have a little more space than in conventional animal husbandry and their feed contains neither antibiotics nor performance hormones. Genetic engineering is allowed up to 0.9% and some practices that are harmful to the environment, for example to combat fungi, may still be used."),

Vegetables may only be grown on natural soil and no genetic engineering whatsoever may be used. Recyclable packaging is also required."),

Genetic engineering is also completely excluded. However, every company must keep animals, but dehorning shouldn\'t be performed and the keeping of polled breeds is also prohibited. The entire company must operate ecologically."),

Only 44 additives (instead of over 300 in conventional agriculture) are tolerated. This label is, however, under strong criticism, because farms do not have to be fully converted to organic production, animals can still be fed with genetically modified feed, and meat, blood and bone meal can be used as fertilizer. There are also no regulations for observing human rights at the courts."),
    "fairtrade" : MessageLookupByLibrary.simpleMessage("The Fairtrade label promises humane working conditions for the farmer, the abolition of child labor, and fixed prices for the farmer, so that he is no longer dependent on the strongly fluctuating world market prices. Fairtrade products also offer the possibility of tracing the production steps. In the past, however, this label has also received criticism, so \"fair\" and \"unfair\" ingredients can be mixed and the end product can still bear the label, albeit with a marked amount compensation. The pricing is also opaque, so the product is sometimes significantly more expensive, but the farmer does not receive this large part by far."),

But there are also many criticisms, so Greenpeace claims, MSC would issue the label too early and a \"promise\" to MSC: \"In the future something will improve\" is enough to get the certification. In some cases, problematic fishing methods may still be used, which for example cause damage to the seabed."),
